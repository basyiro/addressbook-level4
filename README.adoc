* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* This application targets users who is adept at using the keyboard, and prefers adding contacts solely with the keyboard, rather than using a mouse. As a result, most of the available commands can be done using just a keyboard.
