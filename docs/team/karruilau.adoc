=== Enhancement Added: Setting of homepage

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=edit]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previous behaviour of both add and edit did not allow the user to set their homepage to something more useful.

This implementation now enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to set relevant homepages for
each individual contact, such as their Facebook or LinkedIn profiles.

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Previously, the `list` view of the application would show contacts in the order they were added. For an address book
with many contacts added, sorting would allow the user (who, for some reason, does not want to use the `find` command)
to be able to view the contact list in alphabetical ascending/ descending order.

=== Enhancement Added: Set avatar

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=avatar]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Setting an avatar is a natural extension of an address book application

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Recent contacts

==== External behavior
---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=recent]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Finding recently searched for contacts is a natural extension of an address book application, provides convenience to user.

==== Implementation
