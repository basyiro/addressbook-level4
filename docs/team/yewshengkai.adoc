=== Enhancement Added: Find/Findany feature with prefixes

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Previous behaviour of find operation did not allow the user to search for other details except for their name.

This implementation now enhances the usability of the application by allowing the user to utilizes different prefixes to search
for single/multiple contact details or a portion of details.
